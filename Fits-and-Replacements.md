# Observational Fits & Replacements in Standard Physics

## How VSR Fits "End Results" (Key Observations)
VSR matches data via emergent mechanisms, resolving standard model issues.

- **Redshift/Hubble Tension**: γ damping fades waves; no expansion. Fits SN Ia/BAO; explains ~10% discrepancy via regional γ inhomogeneities.
- **Cosmic Structures**: Sympathetic resonances + vis neutra sinks form web/filaments. Fits CMB fluctuations (~10^{-5}) as pop echoes; explains anomalies like Giant Arc without dark matter.
- **Galactic Rotations**: Vis neutra whirlpools provide apparent mass; dilatancy hardens orbits. Fits flat curves; aligns with MOND/AeST without halos.
- **Black Holes/Bursts**: Knots as dense equilibria; pops via overload. Fits quasar jets/TDE flares/Sgr A* variability; no singularities, slow γ erosion (Hawking analog).
- **Light Propagation**: Emergent c from elastic waves; refraction in sinks (lensing). Fits invariance + bending; predicts fade in dense regions.
- **Entropy/Time**: Drag dissipation; duality resolves low-entropy puzzle eternally. Fits irreversibility without initial conditions.

Predictions: Variable damping in high-z data (JWST testable); no dark signals.

## What VSR Replaces in Standard Physics
VSR minimizes extras, unifying via one field.

- **Big Bang/Inflation**: Replaced by eternal Lake with local pops (bursts as "origins" for observers).
- **Dark Matter**: Emergent from vis neutra whirlpools + dilatancy inertia.
- **Dark Energy**: Emergent acceleration from damping gradients or creep.
- **GR Spacetime/Metric**: Replaced by refraction in VSR density (no curvature; elasticity β suffices).
- **Quantum Fields/Probabilities**: Replaced by deterministic topology (knots) + hysteresis (duality without waves/particles).
- **Separate Forces**: Unified: EM from piezoelectric shear; weak/strong as defect modes.

Advantages: Fewer parameters, no fine-tuning, eternal coherence.
