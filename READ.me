# Scalar Relaxation Cosmology (SRC) & Viscoelastic Strain Reservoir (VSR)

An alternative cosmological framework proposing the observable universe emerges from relaxation processes in a single, eternal viscoelastic scalar field (the substrate, denoted φ or VSR).

### Core Idea
The universe is an eternal "Lake" or energy crystal—a high-density scalar displacement field acting as a "strange battery." All phenomena (particles, forces, light, gravity, time, cosmic structures) are transient patterns of strain energy reorganizing via damped-wave dynamics. No Big Bang, dark matter/energy, inflation, or metric expansion required.

### Key Features
- Master equation: damped nonlinear wave with viscoelastic terms.
- Emergent gravity: vis neutra (neutral reformation drag toward sinks).
- Time arrow: dissipative drag (irreversible relaxation).
- Light/EM: piezoelectric shear from locked strain.
- Events: dilatancy locks → overload pops → devolution.

### Why This Approach?
Fits observations (redshift as damping, galactic rotations as whirlpools, quasar bursts as knot pops) while remaining minimal: one field, measurable parameters (β elasticity, γ damping, α dilatancy, χ piezoelectric).

### Current Status
This is Version 1 thinking—analog mental sims being formalized. See Glossary.md for terms and Technical-Foundations.md for derivations.

### Next Steps
- Formalize simulations (e.g., 1D/2D Python for dilatancy thresholds).
- Expand to Ver 2 Manual (biology, quantum extensions).
- Open for discussion/contributions.
