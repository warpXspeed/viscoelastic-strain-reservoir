# Glossary: SRC & VSR Terms

### Core Substrate Terms
- **Viscoelastic Strain Reservoir (VSR)** / **Substrate φ** / **Energy Crystal** / **Lake**: The singular, eternal scalar field φ. A viscoelastic medium storing latent strain energy (½(∇φ)² + V(φ)). Dual nature: fluid-like viscous relaxation at low strains, crystal-like elastic resonance at high strains.

- **Vis Neutra**: Neutral, monopole-like attractive reformation drive. Emerges from gradient minimization (density sinks pull all strains). Analog to gravity; omnipresent drag toward equilibrium.

- **Dilatancy / Shear-Thickening Lock**: Nonlinear increase in effective viscosity γ_eff under high strain rates. Triggers fluid-to-solid transition: viscous dominance → elastic dominance. Enables directional hardening and wave propagation.

- **Butterfly Event / η-Noise**: Stochastic perturbation (vacuum jitter) in the field. Triggers micro-locks or amplifies overloads.

- **Pop / Burst / Overload Discharge**: Catastrophic release of trapped strain when locked energy exceeds thresholds. Ejects defects (matter), shear modes (EM/light), damped waves. Scales: micro (particle creation) to macro (quasar/nova analogs).

### Dynamics & Emergent Terms
- **Sympathetic Harmonic Resonance (f_res)**: Frequency locking between defects/knots. Amplifies cohesion, guides clustering (cosmic web).

- **Hysteresis / Memory Wakes**: Lingering distortions from past strains (timescale τ_mem ≈ 1/γ). Creates paths for future dynamics (entanglement analog).

- **Devolution**: Irreversible dissipation via damping γ. Drains organized strain toward uniform equilibrium. Defines time arrow locally (disorder increase) while globally repacking to order.

- **Strain Battery**: Latent energy storage in scalar displacements. Charges via vis neutra tightening; discharges via pops.

- **Piezoelectric Coupling (χ)**: Shear deformations in locked VSR generate vector EM fields. Emergent source of light/radiation.

### Scales & Parameters
- **β**: Elastic modulus (wave speed; c ≈ √(β / ρ_eff)).
- **γ**: Damping/relaxation coefficient (viscous drag; redshift fade).
- **α**: Dilatancy coefficient (nonlinear thickening strength).
- **V(φ)**: Multi-well potential (stability thresholds, defect formation).
