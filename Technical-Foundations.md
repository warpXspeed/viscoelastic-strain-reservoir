# Technical Foundations of SRC & VSR

### Master Equation
∂²_t φ = β ∇² φ - γ_eff ∂_t φ - dV/dφ + η(t,x)

With γ_eff = γ_0 + α (∂_t ∇φ)^2 (nonlinear dilatancy).

### Key Dynamics
1. **Fluid Regime** (low strain rate): Viscous damping dominates → relaxation, drag.
2. **Lock Threshold**: High |∂_t ∇φ| → γ_eff surge → elastic dominance (solid-like).
3. **Directional Hardening**: Anisotropic along principal gradient/spin axis.
4. **Pop Trigger**: Overload in locked state → piezoelectric discharge → EM waves/defects at c = √(β / ρ_eff).
5. **Emergent Gravity**: Vis neutra drag toward sinks.
6. **Time**: Dissipative drag (γ term) — local entropy rise, global decrease (repacking).

### Observational Fits
- Redshift: γ damping.
- Galactic rotations: Whirlpool drag.
- Bursts: Knot pops.
- Light: Emergent from shear in locked VSR (directional transmutation).

See Glossary.md for terms. Simulations forthcoming.
