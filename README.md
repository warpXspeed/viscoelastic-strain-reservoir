# Viscoelastic Strain Reservoir (VSR) in Scalar Relaxation Cosmology (SRC)

This repository formalizes the Viscoelastic Strain Reservoir (VSR)—a proposed eternal, scalar substrate underpinning all reality in SRC. VSR replaces ad-hoc elements in standard cosmology/physics with a single, viscoelastic energy field that relaxes via damped waves, giving rise to particles, forces, light, gravity, time, and cosmic structures.

## What is VSR?
VSR is the singular, infinite "Lake" or energy crystal: a scalar displacement field φ storing latent strain energy. It's viscoelastic—fluid-like for slow changes (viscous drag/relaxation), crystal-like for rapid stresses (elastic resonance/hardening). All "stuff" emerges from its patterns; the universe is eternal, with no beginning or end—just cyclic devolution and reformation.

## What Does VSR Do?
- **Stores & Reorganizes Energy**: Acts as a "strange battery" charging via strain accumulation, discharging via pops.
- **Drives Dynamics**: Tighten (vis neutra pull) → lock (dilatancy) → pop (release) → devolve (damping fade).
- **Emerges Phenomena**: Particles as knots, gravity as drag, light as shear waves, time as dissipation.

## How It Works
See Technical-Foundations.md for the master equation and mechanisms.

## How It Fits Observations
VSR resolves tensions in standard models (e.g., Hubble discrepancy, no dark sectors) while matching data (redshift, rotations, bursts). See Fits-and-Replacements.md.

## What It Replaces in Standard Physics
- Big Bang/Inflation → Eternal cycles of local pops.
- Dark Matter/Energy → Emergent from vis neutra and damping.
- GR Metric/Expansion → Refraction in density gradients.
- Quantum Probabilities → Deterministic hysteresis wakes.

## Getting Started
1. Read Glossary.md for terms.
2. Dive into Technical-Foundations.md for equations.
3. Explore Fits-and-Replacements.md for comparisons.
4. Contribute: Add sims (e.g., Python for dilatancy) or issues.
